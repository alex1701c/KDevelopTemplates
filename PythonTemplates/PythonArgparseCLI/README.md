Template for Python3 CLI using argparse
---------------------------------------

These projects set up command line applications im Python3 which uses argparse.
Furthermore they have custom HelpFormatter class which improves the formatting
of the help output and makes further customization easy.

The typed template additionally casts the parsing results to the defined ArgsNamespace class.
This makes no difference at runtime but it provides better autocompletion.

The modular template is additionally organized using modules and has build scripts for snap, deb and standalone releases.
